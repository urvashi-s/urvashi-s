Hello, I am an Immunology Data Analyst at CellCarta. I am a recent graduate in Microbiology and Immunology from McGill University. My research interests are at the intersection of infectious diseases, genomics, and epidemiology.

I collaborate with the Langlais Lab at the McGill Genome Centre for bioinformatics projects. Currently, I am contributing to a project investigating the effect of thermoregulation on the immune response to _Leishmania_ infections in a murine model. 

I am committed to health care equity and accessibility.
